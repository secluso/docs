# Recommended Hardware

Secluso runs on **any Raspberry Pi** (Zero 2W, 3B, 4, 5 all work).  
We recommend the **Zero 2W** because it’s small, efficient, and can handle one camera with motion detection.

---

## Option A — Standard Pi Camera + Light Sensor (paired)

- [**Raspberry Pi Zero 2W**](https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Zero-Bluetooth-RPi-2W/dp/B09LH5SBPS)
- [**Raspberry Pi Camera Module v2**](https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Pi-Camera-Module-Megapixel/dp/B01ER2SKFS)
- **Case**: [Raspberry Pi Official Enclosure (with camera hole)](https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Official-Enclosure-Camera-Compatible/dp/B07QJZBXYC)
- **Optional Light Sensor**: Motion-activated, paired with the Pi Camera to improve night detection  
  * Example: [EverBrite Sensor](https://www.amazon.com/EverBrite-Battery-Bathroom-Batteries-Included/dp/B08Y8QCZ6M)

> Use this setup if you want the **official Pi camera** and can add a simple light sensor for low-light conditions.

## Option B — Integrated Adjustable-Focus Camera (alternative)

- [**Raspberry Pi Zero 2W**](https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Zero-Bluetooth-RPi-2W/dp/B09LH5SBPS)

<summary><strong>Case and Camera Pairings</strong></summary>

**Option (easy)**  
Use the included acrylic mount for the camera and a separate Pi case:
- [MakerFocus Adjustable Focus Camera + Acrylic Mount](https://www.amazon.com/MakerFocus-Raspberry-Camera-Adjustable-Focus-Fisheye/dp/B07BK1QZ2L)  
- [iUniker Raspberry Pi Acrylic Case](https://www.amazon.com/iUniker-Raspberry-Starter-Acrylic-Clear/dp/B075FLGWJL/)

**Option (advanced)**  
Use a 3D-printed case that holds both the Pi and the night-vision camera:
- [3D printed case design](https://gmail784811.autodesk360.com/g/shares/SH56a43QTfd62c1cd9681e75e6af7b61dce3)
- [Night Vision Camera Without Mount]( https://www.amazon.com/MELIFE-Raspberry-Camera-Adjustable-Focus-Infrared/dp/B08RHZ5BJM/)

If you have another night vision camera or prefer to buy a different option, it most likely will work. These are just recommendations.

</details>

> This option is for those who prefer an **all-in-one camera module** with adjustable focus. Case choice depends on whether you want to mount the camera separately or integrate everything together.
